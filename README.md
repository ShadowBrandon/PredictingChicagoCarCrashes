# PredictingChicagoCarCrashes


Objective: Predict whether there would be an injury in a beat in Chicago given weahter information

Data: Collected from the City of Chicago Database and NOAA weather data for Chicago for the past couple years

Method: 
- Explore the data and eliminate variables are irrelevant in the model making process
      - Target: injury or no injury that was done with some feature engineering
- Merge tables from the NOAA weather data onto the Chicago weather by date
- Apply methods of classification along with sampling techniques

Conclusion:
- Daily weather data is not strong enough alone in predicting whether an injury would occur at a beat level
